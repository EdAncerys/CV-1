---------

An energetic and values-driven full stack developer currently working at The Victoria and Albert Museum after graduating from Makers, a developer bootcamp in London.

I am passionate about data and the ability to delve into databases to reveal stories about peoples lives. I want to build on my existing strengths and expertise as a technically astute analyst and plan to combine this with coding knowledge to enable me to design and create effective software solutions, ideally in a socially responsible area.

I am also a qualified CIMA accountant and have previously held a number of Senior Finance roles within the NHS. I have extensive experience in technical healthcare roles, covering areas such as acute finance commissioning, income reporting, PbR, reference costing, SLR, patient level costing and financial planning. All my previous roles have had a strong technical slant and I have developed strong skills in VBA and tSQL.

I have multiple interests such as ice-swimming and powerlifting that occupy me in my spare time - see [Hobbies and Interests](#hobbies-and-interests) for more details.

**Tech Skills :** Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Node.js, tSQL, HTML, CSS, MS Excel, VBA

## Skills

#### Analytical and Judgement Skills

A concise, logical thinker with an ability to exploit technical skills to solve problems rapidly and clearly. My joy of solving problems has been well tested at Makers where I've faced implementation and logic problems on a daily basis, my prior experience has helped me remain calm and apply a logical, scientific approach to resolving the current issue. It is this rollercoaster of frustration and reward that makes coding so appealing for me.

#### Technical Skills

Advanced Excel and SQL data skills with a proven ability to transform vast, complex data into meaningful management reports.

tSQL / MS Query / SSIS - writing queries and procedures to automate processes. Large scale project examples include:
- scripting the financial reconciliation for a patient level costing project spanning multiple organisations and patient pathways (NWL Whole Systems)
- generating the trust income plans from the bottom-up, allowing all components of change (eg. growth) to be identified and reported. Process included version control to roll back changes
- Scripting patient level costs from Patient Administration Systems (PAS)

#### Communication

Ability to impart technical information clearly, to a range of specialists and senior managers. Honest approach resulting in trusted relationships with senior colleagues. Run regular lunch and learn sessions at work to encourage debate and knowledge share. I host a number of [technical blogs](#technical-blogging) where I write tutorials on key analytical skills. If I had a mission statement it would probably be `Learn cool things and share`.

#### Management

Provide strong, value driven leadership. Brought the NCL Acute Finance team through three major reorganisations and ensured continuity and quality of departmental output. I have a strong reputation for being delivery-focussed and efficient.

#### Continuous Development

Improvement focused - value continuous development both individually and departmentally. I love a challenge and am becoming ever more comfortable with feeling very uncomfortable!

## Education

#### Makers (June 2018 - October 2018)

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, where we learn to handle new technologies and languages in a group setting. It was an amazing experience where we learned to handle a steady stream of new challenges and developed the skills to unpick error messages and rescue ourselves without panic. Here I have learned to work in groups following an Agile framework where we use daily standups to ensure we are on track to deliver our target features. I have experience now in writing fullstack applications using a combination of Ruby and Javascript with frameworks such as Rails and React. All projects have been created using TDD approaches.

**BPP London** - CIMA full accountancy qualification (2006 - 2009)

#### University College London (2003 - 2006)

- PhD Chemistry (Astrochemistry)
- Thesis title: Formation of Alcohol on Interstellar Dust Grain Analogues
- This was an experimental PhD involving serious spanner skills. I maintained a huge vacuum chamber that enabled me to recreate interstellar conditions (extremely low temperatures and pressures) and performed gas bombardment experiments on a small piece of graphite suspended in the middle of the chamber. This experience taught me very high levels of patience and the ability to process large volumes of data.

**Open University** - BSc in Natural Sciences with Chemistry 1st Class Hons (1995 - 2000)

**Sheffield University** - 2nd MB Medicine (1989 - 1993)

**Headlands School Bridlington** - A levels in Chemistry (A), Physics (B), Biology (A) and AS Maths (1989)

## Hobbies and Interests
I’m a medically and accountancy trained full stack developer with a PhD in Astrochemistry but I could also be described as a serial dabbler with multiple full time interests. I document almost all of these interests in one or more blogs.

#### Fitness and Health
My health and sporting exploits are featured on my [warriorwomen blog](http://warriorwomen.co.uk)
- **Powerlifting** - I have competed in a number of regional competitions and qualified for the All England Championships.
- **Ice Swimming** - Having been inspired by Wim Hof I have taken to swimming outdoors throughout the winter months. I take great pleasure in cracking the ice at Tooting Bec Lido and have been delighted to swim during snow flurries.
- **Running** - I used to be pretty serious about running (although always in a very slow and plodding fashion), now I am only encouraged to jog for Obstacle events such as Wolf Run.

#### Technical Blogging
I have a number of blogs for sharing tutorials on technical issues of for training people in specific skills.

- *[NHS Excel Blog](http://nhsexcel.com) - designed to share specific excel tips and tricks for other NHS Accountants*
- *[Excel Pivots Blog](http://excelpivots.com) - tips and tricks focussed on the marvellous pivot table*
- *[Whatapalaver Blog](http://whatapalaver.co.uk) - assorted technical trickery explained. It's also where I have been documenting my coding journey with Makers*
